                Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.
                <br>
                Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.
                <br>
                It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us.

                There is nothing enlightened about shrinking
                <br>
                so that other people won't feel insecure around you.

                We are all meant to shine, as children do.
                <br>
                And as we let our own light shine,
                <br>
                we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.
                <br>
                As we are liberated from our own fear,
                <br>
                our presence automatically liberates others.
